# Data Types

These are the implemented data types:

## Integer `int`
This is an integer number. It is implemented as a 64-bit signed integer. This is not exactly equivalent to true Python `int`, which is unlimited precision. This may be implemented as a BigInt instead later.

## Float `float`
This is a double-precision floating-point number.

## Boolean `bool`
This represents truth values. It has two values: True and False. it is implemented as an 8-bit unsigned integer.

## String `str`
This is an immutable string of characters. It is implemented as a constant character array.
